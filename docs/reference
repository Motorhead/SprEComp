SprEComp

The language has a syntax very similar to ASM. I'll start with some definitions:
	Image		a file which should be in the same folder as your code. Many 
				formats are supported. For more information look at DevIL's 
				documentation.
				
	Frame		a frame is any portion of an image.
	
	Sprite		a sprite is a sequence of frames.
	
	Tag			a tag is a place you defined in the code where you can jump to. 
				Tags can only be placed before a 'ren' statement.
				
The language consists of two directives: img and frm, and two instructions: ren
and jmp. SprEComp code files must be saved with the extension: '.s'. You cannot 
place directives after the first instruction has been written.  Anything after a
';' is considered as a comment, and thus ignored by the compiler.

	img
		syntax: img image_name, location
			image_name 		Identifier for this image.
			location		String containing the name of the file, along with
							its extension.
							
		example: img flower, "flower.jpg"
		
	
	frm
		syntax: frm frame_name, image, x, y, w, h, duration
		
			frame_name		Identifier for this frame.
			image			Image (must be declared before the frame)
			x				X position in the image where the frame starts.
			y				Y position in the image where the frame starts.
			w				Width of the frame, starting from x.
			h				Height of the frame, starting from y.
			duration		Duratio of this frame in miliseconds.

		example: frm first, flower, 0, 0, 10, 20, 250
		
	ren
		syntax: ren frame
				ren frame, duration
			frame		Frame to render
			duration	Render with a different duration, in miliseconds.
				
		example: ren first
				 ren first, 300
				 
	
	jmp
		syntax: jmp tag
				tag		Jump to... tag.
